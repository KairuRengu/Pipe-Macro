*Purpose for Exisiting: Needed to find a faster way to import variation products into a Wordpress Site and we kepy having to                        add pipes to every attribute in an Excel file. To cut down the time used on it I made this macro to
                       make things easier.
*Efficiency:            It's not a very efficient macro, because it is a O^2 Big O Notation.
