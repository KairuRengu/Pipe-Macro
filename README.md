Pipe-Macro
==========

Language :             VBA <br/>
Date Created:          July 22nd, 2014<br/>
Purpose for Exisiting: Needed to find a faster way to import variation products into a Wordpress Site and we kepy having to
                  <br/>add pipes to every attribute in an Excel file. To cut down the time used on it I made this macro to                         make things easier.<br/>
Efficiency:            It's not a very efficient macro, because it is a O^2 Big O Notation.
